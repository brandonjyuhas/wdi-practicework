 
<p>Three weeks ago a group of 18 strangers banded together to banish bad code.  Following their intrepid leaders into the bowels of Ruby, our fearless programmers are conquering code one bug at a time.</p>
<p>All was well in the WDI until Cowboy Coder Jessse went rogue and tried to restyle the whole web.</p>
<p>With great coding comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Join us in our quest to keep the web free of CSS tyrrany.</p>
